## [Unreleased] — 2026-03-04

### UI / Layout — Desktop 3-Column Redesign
- Replaced the old top-bar + grid-board desktop layout with a full-viewport 3-column flex layout activated at ≥768 px; mobile swipe layout is completely untouched.
- **Left column (250 px):** contains the title, DiceTower card, SpectatorTile card, and PlayerCard (inline mode) stacked vertically with independent scroll.
- **Center column (flex 1):** contains a single `.game-card` wrapper that holds the Board, which now scales with the available space.
- **Right column (250 px):** contains BettingPanel, TurnOrder, and SnailStandings as separate cards.
- Lobby (setup phase) still uses the original `.app-root` centred layout, unchanged.
- Removed the fixed slide-in `PlayerCard` panel from the desktop game view (the `←/→` toggle) as player info now lives inline in the left column.

### UI / Board — Oval Horseshoe Layout
- Replaced the 2-row CSS grid (`repeat(8,1fr)`) with an absolute-position oval/horseshoe layout.
- Added `SPACE_COORDS` constant (16 entries of `{x,y}` percentages) placing spaces #1–#16 around a CCW horseshoe: #1 bottom-right (start) → up the right leg → across the top arc → down the left leg → #16 bottom-left (near finish).
- Container uses a `paddingTop: '65%'` aspect-ratio trick so the board scales proportionally with the center column width.
- All existing snail hop/spectator-bounce animation logic, `displayTrack` derivation, and `renderSpace` content are preserved exactly — only the spatial layout changed.
- `SPACE_COORDS` values are clearly documented as tuning targets for when stone-tile PNG assets arrive; a `bgSrc` prop hook is noted in the component comment.

### UI / PlayerCard — Inline Mode
- Added `inlineMode` boolean prop (default `false`) to `PlayerCard`.
- When `inlineMode` is true, renders player info (name header, coins, leg bets, race bets, spectator tile status) as a plain inline `div` in document flow — no fixed panel, no toggle button, no `mousemove` listener.
- Existing `mobileMode` prop path and legacy slide-in panel are both preserved for backward compatibility.

### UI / styles.css
- Removed `padding-right: 0` from `.app-root` (was added to compensate for the 380 px fixed PlayerCard panel, which no longer exists on desktop).
- Updated `@media (max-width: 1024px)` `.app-root` override: restored `padding-right: 8px` (was `0`).

## [Unreleased] — 2026-03-04

### UI / DiceTower
- Replaced text labels (e.g. "G3", "B2") on rolled dice with proper pip dot layouts matching a real physical die (values 1–6 rendered on a 3×3 grid).
- Added `DieFace` component with correct standard pip positions for all 6 values; pip colour is white on all dice except yellow (dark brown) and crazy-white (dark grey) for contrast.
- Coloured die backgrounds and sizing unchanged; only the face content changed.

### UI / Background
- Applied `background-landscape.png` as a full-cover fixed background for desktop (≥768 px) on both the Lobby and Game pages via a `@media (min-width: 768px)` rule on `body`.
- Updated `.game-card` on desktop to use `rgba(255,248,238,0.93)` with `backdrop-filter: blur(4px)` so cards remain readable against the grass background.
- Changed desktop `body` fallback colour from `#f0e8d8` to `#3a6b35` to match the green background while the image loads.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-03-03

### PWA Setup
- Installed `vite-plugin-pwa` as a dev dependency to enable Progressive Web App support.
- Created `vite.config.js` with `VitePWA` plugin configured: `registerType: 'autoUpdate'`, full web manifest (name, short_name, description, theme_color `#b98a49`, background_color `#fff8ee`, display `standalone`, start_url `/`), and icon entries for 192×192 and 512×512 PNGs under `/icons/`.
- Updated `index.html` `<head>` with Apple PWA meta tags (`apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style`, `apple-mobile-web-app-title`, `apple-touch-icon`) and `theme-color` meta tag for Android/Chrome.
- Created `vercel.json` with cache-control headers (`public, max-age=0, must-revalidate`) for `sw.js` and Workbox chunks to ensure the service worker is never stale-cached on Vercel.

### UI / Lobby
- Fixed desktop lobby rendering: removed the standalone `if (state.phase === 'setup')` guard that wrapped `<Lobby />` in a bare flex container with no intrinsic width (causing the panel's `width: 100%` to collapse to 0 and leaving only the tiny Game Manual button visible). Reverted to the original `state.phase === 'setup'` ternary inside `app-root`, which provides a proper parent width for the panel.
- Fixed stale `{false ? <Lobby /> : (...)}` left over from a previous edit; restored `state.phase === 'setup'` as the ternary condition.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-03-03

### UI / Lobby
- Used `public/lobby/lobby-panel.png` as the background image of the Lobby panel (`background-size: 100% 100%`), with `aspect-ratio: 766/985` keeping the image proportions locked at all screen sizes.
- All interactive elements (title, input strip, players list, Clear/Randomize buttons, Start Game, Game Manual link) are positioned via `position: absolute` with percentage-based `top`/`left`/`right`/`height` values calibrated to match each painted zone in the background image.
- Input field uses a semi-transparent dark wood fill so text is readable over the painted wood strip.
- Players list uses a near-transparent overlay so the parchment texture underneath shows through.
- Fixed lobby overflow on desktop: extracted a dedicated early-return `setup` guard in the desktop code path of `App.jsx` that renders a full-screen centred wrapper (instead of embedding Lobby inside `app-root` with an `<h1>` above it); removed `minHeight: 100dvh` from the Lobby outer wrapper so it no longer forces the page to scroll.
- Moved the Game Manual button from the bottom-centre (`top: 92%`) to the top-right corner of the panel (`top: 8%, right: 12%`) so it is always accessible without interfering with the main action area.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-03

### UI / Mobile
- Added horizontal swipe gesture to navigate between Board, Play, and My Card tabs on mobile.
- All three tab panels are now rendered simultaneously in a side-by-side track (`width: 100vw * 3`) that slides with a `translateX` CSS transform — enabling smooth hardware-accelerated transitions.
- Swipe axis is determined after 8 px of movement: if the gesture is primarily horizontal it becomes a tab swipe; if primarily vertical, natural scroll is preserved (prevents conflict with the board's internal horizontal scroll and the panels' vertical scroll).
- Real-time drag offset (`liveOffset`) moves the track in sync with the finger during the swipe, snapping to the target tab on `touchEnd` with a `cubic-bezier(0.25, 1, 0.5, 1)` spring transition.
- Edge resistance: dragging past the first or last tab damps to 25% motion to hint there's nothing further.
- Commit threshold is 55 px — short accidental brushes don't trigger a tab change.
- Each slot div owns its own `overflow-y: auto` with independent vertical scroll; clipping shell uses `overflow: hidden`.
- Added full mobile portrait layout for screens ≤ 767 px wide — triggers a three-tab bottom-navigation shell instead of the desktop layout.
- **Tab 1 – Board**: shows the track (horizontally scrollable), Snail Standings, Turn Order, and a collapsible Event Log.
- **Tab 2 – Play**: shows Dice Tower, Betting Panel, and Spectator Tile panel stacked vertically.
- **Tab 3 – My Card**: shows the current player's coins and leg bets as an inline panel (no slide-in behavior).
- Added a sticky mobile header displaying the game title, current-player name badge, and remaining dice count.
- Applied the grass/garden background image (`/background/background.png`) to the page body on mobile via a CSS `@media (max-width: 767px)` rule; cards become semi-transparent (`rgba(255,248,238,0.94)`) with `backdrop-filter: blur` so the background shows through.
- Added mobile Lobby layout: setup phase on mobile uses a simple scrollable page with the same background.
- `PlayerCard` now accepts a `mobileMode` boolean prop — when true the hover/slide-in mechanism is disabled and the component renders as an inline element, not a fixed-position panel.
- Mobile CSS classes added: `.mobile-header`, `.mobile-content`, `.mobile-tab-bar`, `.mobile-tab-btn`, `.mobile-board-scroll`.
- Desktop layout is entirely unaffected.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-03

### UI / Board
- Board spaces now show hover highlight (gold tint + gold border + pointer cursor) **only** on spaces that are valid for spectator tile placement (passes `canPlaceSpectator` for the current player). Invalid spaces receive no hover interaction (`cursor: default`). Valid-space hover is only active when placement is allowed (`playing` phase, fewer than 5 dice used).
- Removed `.board-space:hover` CSS rule from `styles.css` — it applied `!important` overrides to every space unconditionally, bypassing the React-controlled validity check. Hover effects now come exclusively from inline styles in `Board/index.jsx`.
- Clicking a valid board space selects it (green tint + border) and shows an inline overlay with a 🚀/🪤 **boost/trap toggle**, a coloured **Place** button, and a **Cancel** button — eliminating the need to type a space number manually.
- The `validSpectatorSpaces` set is memoised in `Board` (recomputes only when `track`, `phase`, `usedDice`, or `currentPlayer.id` change) to avoid calling `canPlaceSpectator` on every render.
- `spaceInput`, `spectatorSide`, and `handleConfirmPlace` lifted to `App` so `Board` and `SpectatorTilePanel` share the same state. `Board` now accepts `selectedSpace`, `spectatorSide`, `onSideChange`, and `onPlace` props.
- `SpectatorTilePanel` action button is now disabled (dimmed) until a space is selected on the board; when a space is selected it reveals a prominent green/red **"Place on #X"** button matching the chosen side.

### Bug Fix / Game Logic
- Fixed crazy-snail carrier rule not being enforced during dice resolution. `useGameState.js` was using `die.crazyColor` directly instead of calling `resolveCrazySnailId()`. Now imports and calls `resolveCrazySnailId(state.track, die.crazyColor)` in the `ROLL_DIE` case, so that if exactly one crazy snail is carrying a non-crazy snail the carrier always moves regardless of which colour the grey die shows.

### Tests
- Added `resolveCrazySnailId — carrier rule` describe block in `test/movement.test.js` with five cases: exact bug reproduction (black die / white carries red → white moves), single carrier wins, neither carrying honours die colour, both carrying honours die colour, and crazy-on-crazy top does not count as a carrier.

### UI / Scoreboard
- Added "🐌 New Game" button to the Race Finished screen. Dispatches `RESTART_GAME` to reset state back to the lobby.

### Game Logic
- Added `RESTART_GAME` reducer case in `useGameState.js` — returns a fresh copy of `initialState`, sending the app back to the `setup` phase.

### UI / EventLogWidget
- Replaced button-based open/minimize with hover-to-expand behaviour. The widget shows a compact title tab at all times and expands to the full scrollable log on mouse-enter; collapses again on mouse-leave.

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-03-01

### Bug Fix / Game Logic
- Fixed crash during final scoring: added missing `scoreRace` import in `useGameState.js`. The reducer was calling `scoreRace()` but the function was not imported from `scoring.js`, causing "scoreRace is not defined" error when clicking "Reveal Results & Apply Bets".

### Bug Fix / UI / SpectatorTilePanel
- Fixed DOM nesting warning: changed Spectator Tile panel title from `<p>` to `<div>` to properly contain the `HelpTip` component. React was warning that `<div>` (from HelpTip's tooltip) cannot appear inside `<p>` (the title).

## [Unreleased] — 2026-02-28

### UI / SpectatorTilePanel
- Added missing `HelpTip` (?) tooltip to the Spectator Tile panel title, explaining boost/trap rules and placement constraints.

### UI / BettingPanel
- Fixed leg-bet coin stack: remaining coins no longer shift position when the top tile is taken. Each coin is now positioned using its `originalIdx` (permanent slot in the full 4-tile stack) rather than its current `stackIdx`, so `top`/`bottom` values are stable across stack size changes.
- Reworked leg-bet coin stack positioning: inverted z-index order so the highest-value (bottom) coin has the highest z-index, and switched to `top`-based offsets (`stackIdx * 7px`) for all coins except the top tile which retains `bottom: 0`, making higher-value coins peek visibly above the stack.

### Bug Fix / BettingPanel — Coin Stack Layout (Staircase to Vertical Stack)
- Fixed a layout bug where coin stacks were spreading sideways in a staircase/ladder pattern — coins now form a true **vertical stack** with all coins centered at the same X position
- Changed wrapper positioning from `bottom: stackIdx * COIN_OFFSET` (which offset each coin vertically) to `bottom: 0` (all coins at baseline) and use `zIndex` for layering
- Coins are now perfectly overlapped with `position: absolute` at the same `bottom: 0, left: 0` position, creating a true pile instead of a row
- Added CSS custom property `--coin-stack-depth` (1.5px per coin) to the `coinSettle` animation keyframes, providing a tiny vertical hint of stacking without causing horizontal drift
- Animation now features **pure vertical movement** (only `translateY`, no `translateX` or sideways effects) — coins drop straight down and settle cleanly

### UI / BettingPanel — Gravity-based Coin Stacking
- Redesigned leg bet coin stacks to feel physically grounded: coins stack from bottom-to-top using proper positioning instead of floating from the top
- Coins settle under gravity with a **drop + squash + bounce** animation (420ms) — they fall from above, squash on impact, rebound slightly, then rest
- Added position-based animation delays: coins at the stack's bottom settle first, higher coins follow — creates a natural cascading effect when stacks build
- Enhanced depth perception with `drop-shadow(0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.2))` under each coin, making them feel less flat and more three-dimensional

### Bug Fix / Board — Animation Flash Glitch
- Fixed a visual glitch where the snail would appear at its final destination for one frame before the hop animation started; switched from `useEffect` to `useLayoutEffect` so the animation state (step 0 = pre-move position) is set before the browser paints

### UI / Board — Snail Hop Animation
- Snails now move **space by space** with a stylish jump arc animation after each dice roll instead of teleporting to their destination
- Added `lastMove` metadata to the `ROLL_DIE` reducer result containing the full step path (from → each intermediate space → destination, plus spectator tile redirect)
- Board component computes a "display track" during animation that overrides snail positions, advancing the moving stack one space per hop
- Animation timing is precisely calculated: `INITIAL_DELAY_MS (200) + (hops − 1) × STEP_DELAY_MS (360) + HOP_DURATION_MS (320)` — e.g. a 3-space move takes ~1.2 s
- Spectator tile redirects (boost/trap) get a distinct wobbly bounce animation (`snailSpectatorBounce`) instead of the normal hop
- Each hop uses a key-change trick to force React remount, cleanly restarting the CSS animation
- CSS keyframes include crouch → launch → apex → descend → squash-land phases for a lively cartoon feel

## [0.3.0] — 2026-02-28

### Workflow / Copilot Instructions
- Updated commit message rule: generating a commit message now immediately promotes `[Unreleased]` to a versioned block and opens a fresh `[Unreleased]` section in one step, without requiring a separate confirmation

### Bug Fix / SpectatorTilePanel
- Fixed a turn-skipping bug where clicking the "Apply Tile" button with no changes (same space and same type already on board) would silently end the player's turn; added a no-op guard in `applyTile()` — if `tile.onBoard && tile.position === pos && tile.side === side`, the dispatch is skipped entirely

### UI / BettingPanel
- Replaced flat coloured circles in the Leg Bet Stacks with physically-stacked coin PNG images (`/colored_coins/{color}-coin-{value}.png`); coins are rendered bottom-to-top so the highest-value (top) tile paints on top, each layer offset 8 px downward to give a 3-D stack appearance
- Added a dashed-ring empty-slot placeholder for exhausted stacks and kept scale-on-hover interaction
- Removed the now-unused `colorDot` helper function from `BettingPanel`

### UI / Board
- Removed hover background effects from boosted and trapped board spaces; spaces now show a static colour with no pointer interaction
- Removed unused `bgHover` variable from `renderSpace`
- Added `.board-space--boost` and `.board-space--trap` CSS classes with `!important` overrides so the `.board-space:hover` rule cannot change the background of spectator tile spaces
- Board component applies these classes conditionally based on tile side

### UI / SpectatorTilePanel (App.jsx)
- Merged "Move Tile" and "Flip Side" into a single **Update Tile** button backed by `applyTile()`
- `applyTile()` resolves place / move / flip by checking whether a new space is entered and whether the tile is already on the board; no separate `flipSide()` function needed
- Button label is "Place Tile" when not yet placed, "Update Tile" when already on the board

### UI / Board
- Board space divs now inherit the spectator tile colour as their full background and border (`#d4f0d0` / green for Boost, `#f9d8d8` / red for Trap) instead of only showing a coloured label
- Removed the pill background from the owner-name text inside spectator tile spaces — label is now plain coloured text aligned centrally
- Fixed hover effect on spectator tile spaces: Boost darkens to `#b8e4b3`, Trap to `#f0b5b5`, neutral to `#f5e8cc`; added `transition: background 0.15s`
- Emoji and owner name in the spectator tile label are centred via `textAlign: 'center'` and `justifyContent: 'center'`

### UI / SpectatorTilePanel (App.jsx)
- Reorganised the Spectator Tile interactive controls from a horizontal `flex-wrap` row into a vertical `flex-column` stack
- Space # input, Type select, Place/Move button, and Flip button each stretch to full width
- Button labels improved: "Place" → "Place Tile", "Move" → "Move Tile", "Flip" → "Flip Side"

### UI / Turn Order (App.jsx)
- Moved `maxWidth: 150` and `overflow: hidden` from the player-name `<span>` to the parent `<div>` rows, so the constraint is enforced at the container level
- Name spans retain `textOverflow: ellipsis` + `whiteSpace: nowrap` to render the truncation glyph
